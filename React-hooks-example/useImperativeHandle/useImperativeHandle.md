--> Only thing this hook does is let you create a completely custom value for the ref you return from a custom component. This means you can do more than just assign a single element to your ref for example.

-->It is used in the places where refs to be passed and in HOC.

--> In react documentation: "useImperativeHandle is a React Hook that lets you customize the handle exposed as a ref."

-->function CustomInput(props, ref) {
  useImperativeHandle(ref, () => {
    return { alertHi: () => alert("Hi") }
  })

  return <input style={{ backgroundColor: "red" }} {...props} />
}

export default React.forwardRef(CustomInput)

Here we have the most basic use case of useImperativeHandle which takes 2 parameters. The first parameter is just the ref you are overriding and the second parameter is a function which returns the new value for your ref. In our case the ref for our CustomInput is now an object that contains the single function alertHi

--> useImperativeHandle takes an optional third parameter which is a dependency array. This works just like useEffect in that anytime any of the values in the dependency array change the function passed to useImperativeValue will be rerun and update the value of your ref. This is useful if you depend on certain values like the props.value. If you do not pass this third parameter to useImperativeHandle it will rerun the function you pass to useImperativeHandle and update your ref every time the component is rendered.

--> It is generally recommended to avoid this hook unless it is absolutely needed.
